        I'm Noah Schliesman, a MSEE student at SDSU aiming to specialize in Signal Processing. I recently graduated from the University of San Diego in EE with minors in Computer Science and Math. I currently work as a Data Annotator for Data Annotation, where I perform audits of major LLM responses for complex topics in mathematics, computer science, and other STEM fields.
